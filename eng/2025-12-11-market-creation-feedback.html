    <h1>English Feedback: Market Creation Tasks</h1>
    <p>Here is the evaluation and correction of the English used in the task description.</p>

    <div class="correction-item">
        <div class="original">Original: "The default text for the title and outcomes are good but that should be shown
            as an example so the text should be a little more timid other than the text users enter."</div>
        <div class="corrected">Better: "The default text for the title and outcomes is helpful, but it should be
            displayed as a placeholder (e.g., in a lighter color) rather than as pre-filled editable text."</div>
        <div class="note">Note: "Timid" applies to personality. For UI text, we use "faint", "lighter", or
            "placeholder".</div>
    </div>

    <div class="correction-item">
        <div class="original">Original: "The category should be selected from the list of categories. I think we should
            have categories in the database."</div>
        <div class="corrected">Better: "The category should be selected from a predefined list. We should store these
            categories in the database."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="correction-item">
        <div class="original">Original: "Players/Options in the page is not general. We need more general word like
            options or outcomes. And 'Add Player' are not adequate."</div>
        <div class="corrected">Better: "The terms 'Players' or 'Options' on the page are not generic enough. We should
            use a more general term like 'Outcomes'. Additionally, the label 'Add Player' is inappropriate."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="correction-item">
        <div class="original">Original: "The default Resolution Date is not good. It should be one month from today."
        </div>
        <div class="corrected">Better: "The current default Resolution Date is unsuitable. It should be set to one month
            from today."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="correction-item">
        <div class="original">Original: "Create 3 Markets & Provide Liquidy should be changed becuase it confuse users
            who think they're creating one market."</div>
        <div class="corrected">Better: "The label 'Create 3 Markets & Provide Liquidity' needs to be changed, as it
            might confuse users who think they are creating only a single market."</div>
        <div class="note">Note: Corrected spelling of "becuase" to "because" and "Liquidy" to "Liquidity".</div>
    </div>

    <div class="correction-item">
        <div class="original">Original: "Most importantly, clicking 'Create' button should work like using scripts like
            ..."</div>
        <div class="corrected">Better: "Most importantly, clicking the 'Create' button should execute logic similar to
            the scripts found in ..."</div>
    </div>
