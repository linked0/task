# Summary
This is the list of additional tasks in response to your latest implementation of the detail page. Your workspace should be in the `/Users/jay/work/nostra-server`, `/Users/jay/work/nostra-contracts`, and `/Users/jay/work/task` folders. You don't need to check the folder `/Users/jay/work/web` that you acutally have to avoid.

# Prerequisites
Before checking the Tasks, you should review the "Basic" sections to avoid confusing the UI representation with the underlying process. Keep this in mind when implementing the detail page.

# Task-1: My Position Common Top Part

One card of common part will have the portfolio that have the information about portfolio and the current price of the portfolio and also have the cash that is left in the portfolio. The other card will have the profit and loss of the portfolio for the specified period that include 1D, 1W, 1M, 3M, 6M, 1YD, 1Y, All.

The claims tab in below part of the my position page. You just need to implement this part. This part should show the claims that are created by the user. User can claim the payout by clicking the "Claim" button. The claim function will call the resolve API endpoint to properly resolve the market and distribute payouts. The claims button should be applied to all the resolved markets.

![Open Orders Table](/images/positions-orders.png)
The open orders tab in below part of the my position page. You just need to implement this part. This part should show the open orders that are created by the user.

# After Tasks Done
You can summarize the what you've done and the changes you've made to the codebase in the file named summary-xxx.md in which xxx is date and time when the summary was created. The file should go to `~/work/task/nostra/dev-logs` folder. If there is already the same file, you can add some number to the file name. In the last part of the file you should add the original request of the tasks described in this file with some vivid separation. I don't think you must change the codebase, but you can just plan the implementation or recommend something after a review and research. Any summary is OK because I can try to have you do something after a review.

Go ahead and thanks in advance!
