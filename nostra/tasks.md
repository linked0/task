# Summary
This is the list of additional tasks in response to your latest implementation of the detail page. Your workspace should be in the `/Users/jay/work/nostra-server`, `/Users/jay/work/nostra-contracts`, and `/Users/jay/work/task` folders. You don't need to check the folder `/Users/jay/work/web` that you acutally have to avoid.

# Prerequisites


# Task-1
Verify Order Cancel functionality.

Check if the Order Cancel feature works correctly.

# Task-2
Fix issue where Limit Sell price is not displayed on the button in the Trading section.

The button should show the price, but currently does not.

# Task-3
"undefined" text appearing in the message box when executing a Sell. 

It looks something went wrong but actually not. Show the correct error message.

# Task-4
Fix inaccurate data display in the top "My Position" section. 

The "My Position" area at the top is not showing the correct value.

# Task-5
Implement UI distinctions for "Resolved" state.

When resolved: display resolution details, disable editing/make read-only, and remove from the Market page.


# After Tasks Done
You can summarize the what you've done and the changes you've made to the codebase in the file named summary-xxx.md in which xxx is date and time when the summary was created. The file should go to `~/work/task/nostra/dev-logs` folder. If there is already the same file, you can add some number to the file name. In the last part of the file you should add the original request of the tasks described in this file with some vivid separation. I don't think you must change the codebase, but you can just plan the implementation or recommend something after a review and research. Any summary is OK because I can try to have you do something after a review.

Go ahead and thanks in advance!
