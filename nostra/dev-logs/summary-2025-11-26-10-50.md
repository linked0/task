# Summary of Changes (2025-11-26)

## Implemented Tasks

### Task-1: Show higher asks when lowest ask is sold out
- **Issue**: The order book was limited to displaying only the top 5 asks. When a user bought all the cheapest shares (lowest asks), the "next best" offers (higher asks) were not visible or accessible, preventing users from buying more liquidity.
- **Fix**: 
    - **Backend**: Updated the `/api/orders/outcome/:outcomeId` endpoint to return the top **50 orders** instead of just 5. This ensures that the frontend has a deep view of the liquidity.
    - **Frontend**: The `MarketDetailPage` automatically renders the available orders. With the increased depth from the API, "higher asks" are now naturally available in the list.
    - **Bug Fix**: Resolved a critical `InvalidSignature` error that occurred when a user tried to "sweep" the order book (buy multiple price levels at once). This was caused by a mismatch in how user-placed limit orders were stored in the database (Raw Units vs. Formatted Units). I fixed the `POST /api/orders/user/create` endpoint to correctly store amounts in formatted units, ensuring the signature verification passes during trade execution.

### UI Improvements (from previous request)
- **Input Fields**: Removed annoying default "0" and hidden browser spin buttons.
- **Trade Panel**: Made "YES" and "NO" outcome text bold and uppercase for better visibility.
- **Market Image**: Added support for displaying the specific market image (e.g., World Cup logo) in the header and trade panel.
