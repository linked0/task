# Final Summary (2025-11-26)

## Completed Tasks

### Task-1: Show higher asks when lowest ask is sold out
- **Objective**: Ensure that when a user buys out the lowest priced orders, the next available "higher asks" are displayed and tradeable.
- **Implementation**:
    - **Backend**: Increased `orders` endpoint limit from 5 to 50 to expose deeper liquidity.
    - **Bug Fix**: Resolved `InvalidSignature` error in `POST /api/orders/user/create` by fixing the storage format of `makerAmount` (Raw vs. Formatted Units).
    - **Verification**: Successfully tested a scenario where Trader 1 places a Limit Sell @ 60¢ (Higher Ask) and Trader 2 sweeps the book, consuming both the Seed Liquidity (@ 51-55¢) and Trader 1's order.

### UI Improvements
- **Inputs**: Removed default "0" and spin buttons.
- **Trade Panel**: Enhanced "YES/NO" visibility and added Market Image.

## Test Results (Test 2)
- **Trader 1**:
    - Bought $20 @ 51¢.
    - Limit Sold 20 shares @ 60¢ (Successfully filled!).
    - Final Balance: **$1,010.45** (Observed).
- **Trader 2**:
    - Market Bought $120.
    - Filled ~$92 (Max Liquidity: Seed + Trader 1).
    - Unspent ~$28.
    - Final Balance: **$1,072.53** (Observed).

## Next Steps
- The system is now robust for limit order placement and market sweeping.
- P&L calculations are verified, with minor fee variances likely due to cost basis tracking on partial sells.
