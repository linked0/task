# Summary of Changes (2025-11-26)

## Implemented Tasks

### Task-1: Unnecessary zero in edit box
- **Issue**: The input fields for Amount and Limit Price displayed a default "0" which was annoying for users.
- **Fix**: Updated the `value` prop of the inputs to render an empty string `''` when the value is `0`. This allows the placeholder to show and prevents the need to delete the initial zero.

### Task-2: Ugly spinner box
- **Issue**: The number inputs had default browser "spin buttons" (up/down arrows) that overlapped with text and looked ugly.
- **Fix**: Added Tailwind CSS utility classes `[appearance:textfield] [&::-webkit-outer-spin-button]:appearance-none [&::-webkit-inner-spin-button]:appearance-none` to the input fields. This hides the native spin buttons across browsers.

### Task-3: Show higher asks
- **Issue**: The order book only displayed the top 5 asks. If the lowest asks were sold out, users couldn't see higher priced orders.
- **Fix**: This was addressed by the previous backend update which increased the order fetch limit from 5 to 50. The frontend automatically renders all returned orders, so sweeping through the book is now visualized correctly.

### Task-4: More vivid Outcome text
- **Issue**: The "Yes" and "No" outcomes in the trade buttons were not prominent enough.
- **Fix**: Updated the trade buttons to display **YES** and **NO** in uppercase and bold font (`font-black`), making the selected side much clearer to the user.

### Task-5: Worldcup logo image in the detail page
- **Issue**: The detail page displayed a generic emoji icon instead of the specific market image (e.g., World Cup logo).
- **Fix**: 
    - Updated the `MarketGroup` interface to include an optional `imageUrl` field.
    - Updated the data fetching logic to map the `imageUrl` from the API response.
    - Modified the header section to render the image using an `<img>` tag if `imageUrl` is present, falling back to the emoji icon if not.

# Original Request

# Task-1: unnecessary zero in edit box
![alt text](../images/26-zero-in-editbox.png)
The zero should not be displayed in the edit box. And when start typing, the zero should be removed.

# Task-2: ungly spinner box
![alt text](../images/26-editbox-ugly.png)
The overlapping zero and caret in the spinner box should be fixed. And the spin buttons in edit box should be removed because there are already the plus/minus buttons next to the edit box.

# Task-3: Show higher asks
There are 5 asks in the orderbook that is displayed. but the lowest ask is sold out, the highest ask should be displayed that are was not displayed before.

# Task-4: More vivid Outcome text
![alt text](../images/26-outcome-text.png)
This is very important because the users should know the outcome of the market. If it's not vivid, the users may not know the outcome of the market.

# Text-5: Worldcup logo image in the detail page
The image should be the same as the one in the home page. It display the baseball ball.
