# Summary
This is the list of additional tasks in response to your latest implementation of the detail page. Your workspace should be in the `/Users/jay/work/nostra-server`, `/Users/jay/work/nostra-contracts`, and `/Users/jay/work/task` folders. You don't need to check the folder `/Users/jay/work/web` that you acutally have to avoid.

# Prerequisites


# Task-1: Claimed or Won in History
You remove the Claim item after a user claimed the winnings. But I think it's good for a user to see the history of their claims with the information of winnings. So you can keep the Claim item in the history but disable the claim button. 


# After Tasks Done
You can summarize the what you've done and the changes you've made to the codebase in the file named `summary.md` in the same folder as the tasks.md And copy it to the foler `~/work/task/nostra/dev-logs` with the name of summary-xxx.md in which xxx is date and time when the summary was created. If there is already the same file, you can add some number to the file name. In the last part of the file you should add the original request of the tasks described in this file with some vivid separation. I don't think you must change the codebase, but you can just plan the implementation or recommend something after a review and research. Any summary is OK because I can try to have you do something after a review.

Go ahead and thanks in advance!
